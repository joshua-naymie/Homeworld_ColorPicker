# Homeworld Teamcolor Picker

This is a WinForms GUI application that allows the user to specify custom badges and team colors for the single player campaigns of both Homeworld 2 Classic and Homeworld Remastered. These can be applied to the user's team/units as well as any CPU team/units that use teamcolors and badges.
